# Plugouts
Plugouts are extended by jQuery, rather than the other way around.

Who cares, right?  Except that whenever you extend jQuery, you add functions to *every* jQuery object.

Plugouts, however, add extended functionality only to the jQuery objects you specifically select.

In every other way, they behave precisely like jQuery plugins.
